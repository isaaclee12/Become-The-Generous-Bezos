THE BASICS FIRST:

Idea:

NOTE: Have a button that says "Pay one average person's expenses"
"Using Jeff Bezos' money, you've:"
"Helped 10 people have food for a year"
"Given 10 people shelter/rent for a year"
"Provided 100 people access to clean water a year"
... etc for each need

At end: "Overall, you've provided the basic needs for (minimum of all numbers) for a year!"


Each need/item should have:
- A picture
- A name
- A plus/minus button
- LATER: The option to just set yourself

Button --> send plus or minus signal to a function that increases or decreases the useState value and shows it via useEffect
AND also updates the money value, which is also updated on screen via useEffect.

NOTE: Ideally we want the money value to change gradually, like 1 at a time in small time intervals b/c it looks cool


All this is just React/useState. BOOM.

END BASICS//

IMPORTANT: a stickied image of Bezos' face that follows you and glows more brightly the more you spend. eventually, it explodes

Other features ideas:
- The amount of houses/foods behind Bezos' image should increase as you continue 
- Fun CSS animations for flair 

END GOAL:

Deploy on replit!!!
